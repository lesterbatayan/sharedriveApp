## To be able to view/modify the code, you need to install an IDE. We recommend VSCode, but you can use any IDE you prefer.
- You can download VSCode from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target=_blank>here</a>
- Run the installer to install VSCode.

## Download or clone code from repositories from Github.
- The code for this app can be copied/downloaded/cloned from this <a href="https://github.com/lesterbatayan/sharedriveApp" target="_blank">repository</a>
- If you are not familiar with cloning commands, you can simply download the ZIPped code.
- In the repository, look for a green dropdown button that says "CODE".
- Click on the little arrow beside it, then click on "Download ZIP".
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
- Open VSCode. Go to "File" -> "Open Folder..."
- Navigate to the location of the extracted ZIP. Confirm.
- You can now view/modify the code.

## To be able to run the application, you need Node.js installed.
- You can download the latest version of Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank">here</a>
- Run the installer to install Node.js.
- To check if Node.js is installed, open a terminal (command prompt) then type
```sh
node -v
```
You should see something like this:
```sh
v16.14.2
```
or whatever Node version you installed.

## To run the application, you need to install the application's dependencies. 
- In the root folder of your application, open a terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```
This will install all dependencies needed by your application.

## You can now compile the application for development
- In the same terminal, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
If there are no errors, you will see something like:
```sh
> sefinalprj@0.0.0 dev
> vite


  VITE v4.2.1  ready in 658 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```
You have now started a development server.
- Copy the url shown in 
```sh
  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```
#### Paste it in a browser, and (if everything went well) you will see the application running in your browser!!
